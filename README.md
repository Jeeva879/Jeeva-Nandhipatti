# Jeeva Nandhipatti 

🎓 **Electronics and Communication Engineering Graduate (2025)**
 💻 **VLSI Design Verification | ASIC / SoC Verification**

I am an ECE graduate with a strong interest in **VLSI Design Verification**, particularly in **ASIC and SoC verification environments**. I am actively building skills in **Verilog**, **SystemVerilog** and **UVM**, with hands-on practice in writing testbenches, assertions, coverage models, and automation scripts.

This GitHub profile documents my **technical learning, verification projects**, and continuous skill development in **VLSI Design Verification**.
